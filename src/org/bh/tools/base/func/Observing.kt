 * Allows you to run code that determines if a value should be set, to prepare for it to be set, andor to react to it
 * being set. The intended syntax is:
 *
 * ```
 * var foo: Bar by Observing(Bar(),
 *     shouldSet = {
 *         baz.isValidState()
 *     },
 *     willSet = {
 *         baz.prepareToDoTheThing()
 *     },
 *     didSet = {
 *         baz.doTheThing()
 *     })
 * ```
 *
 * Note that each observation function is optional! So this is just fine:
 *
 * ```
 * var foo: Bar by Observing(Bar(),
 *     willSet = {
 *         baz.doTheThingPreemptively()
 *     })
 * ```
 *
 * @param initialValue The initial value of the property
 * @param shouldSet    `[optional]` - The block which will be called to determine if a value should be changed.
 *                     Returning `false` from this block will cause the value to remain the same and the `willSet` and
 *                     `didSet` blocks to be skipped. *This is a bad place to put code that you simply want to run
 *                     before the value is set!* If you want to run code before the value is set, but which won't
 *                     help decide if it should be set, use `willSet`.
 * @param willSet      `[optional]` - The block which will be called before the value is changed. At this point, nothing
 *                     will stop the value from being changed. If you want to decide whether the value should change,
 *                     use the `shouldSet` block.
 * @param didSet       `[optional]` - The block which will be called after the value has been changed. It is
 *                     nonsensical to modify the value within this block.
