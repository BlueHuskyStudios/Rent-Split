# Privacy Policy

{{ site.name }} _**has never**_ and _**will never**_ collect personally-identifiable information.


## Auto-save

> **tl;dr** auto-save only saves to your browser/device

If you leave **auto-save off** for {{ site.name }}, then nothing is saved at all, and refreshing, restarting the browser, navigating away, closing & reopening the tab, etc. **will cause everything you put into {{ site.name }} to be deleted.**

If you turn **auto-save on** for {{ site.name }}, then it saves data only to the browser you're using, nowhere else. That means **if you clear cookies/caches, you may lose everything you put into {{ site.name }}.** Also, this means if you open {{ site.name }} in another browser, what you did in this browser **will not transfer**.


## Sharing links

> **tl;dr** your shared links contain your data

You may use the "Share this split with your roommates" feature to generate a link that you can send to your roommates.

This feature generates a very long URL which contains everything you did with {{ site.name }}.

This once sent that URL to the **goo.gl** URL shortener, but that has since shut down. Your URL might still be sent to goo.gl, but it will not be shortened.

The URL you receive contains all the data and information you entered into {{ site.name }}, so anyone who clicks it will be able to see that.

Since {{ site.name }} does not save any of your data, sharing this URL means that other people now have a **copy** of your data, and you retain the original. Their changes cannot affect your usage of {{ site.name }}.

Clicking one of these shared links (or entering it into your browser) will replace any and all data and information you entered into {{ site.name }} with the data and information from that link.



## Google Analytics

> **tl;dr** We use Google Analytics as a glorified hit counter

Unless you have it blocked, {{ site.name }} uses Google Analytics to track the following:
- How many people have visited {{ site.name }} (per hour, per day, per year, etc.)
- What countries those visitors are from
- How many people have clicked a donation link in the past 30 days


Currently, {{ site.name }} only uses Google Analytics as a glorified hit counter, so We will try to ensure it remains configured only for that.
